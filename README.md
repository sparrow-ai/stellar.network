# stellar.network
## Tools for analyzing and displaying data on the Stellar consensus network

This library contains software for running the network analysis and plotting tool presented at http://stellar.network, as well as the network description tool available as a bot in the *Testing* channel on the stellar-public slack portal.

Both the stellar.network service and the slack bot service require that an instance of stellar-core be running locally.  The instance does not need to be participating in the Stellar Consensus Protocol, although it may.
